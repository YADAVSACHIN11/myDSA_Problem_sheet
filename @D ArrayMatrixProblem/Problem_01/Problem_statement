#Problem statement

  You are given a binary matrix (it contains only 0s and 1s) with dimensions ‘N * M’.
You need to find and return the sum of coverages of all zeros of the given matrix.
Coverage for a particular 0 is defined as the total number of ‘1s’ around it (i.e., immediate left, immediate right, immediate up, and immediate bottom positions).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N, M <= 10^3

Time limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
1
2 2 
1 0
0 1
Sample Output 1:
4
Explanation of Input 1:
In the given matrix, there are 2 zeros. 
For the 0 at the 1st row, 2nd column position, coverage is 2(there is 1 adjacent top one and 1 adjacent right one).
For the 0 at the 2nd row, 2nd column the coverage is 2(there is 1 adjacent top one and 1 adjacent right one).

Hence the net coverage is 2 + 2 = 4.
Sample Input 2:
1
2 3
0 0 0
0 0 0
Sample Output 2
0
